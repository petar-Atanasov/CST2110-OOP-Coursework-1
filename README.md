A simple dice game for two players
sitting at the console, i.e., taking turns by sharing the keyboard. The game is a scoring game that requires
five dice. The aim of the game is to be the player with the highest cumulative score after seven rounds of
play.
The game is played over exactly seven rounds i.e., each player will take seven turns. For each
turn, a player has up to three throws of the dice. The aim is for the player to produce a selected die number
with as many of the five dice as possible to gain the highest score for that turn.
Each turn challenges the player to make an early choice of category and then go for it. A different category
must be selected for each turn, i.e., all seven categories must be selected over the seven turns. The game is
mainly luck, but with some strategy.
